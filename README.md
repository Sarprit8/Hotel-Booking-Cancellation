# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
I recently completed a Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis project aimed at addressing the high rate of cancellations observed in both City and Resort Hotels. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and visualization, along with Excel and in-depth analysis, I explored the key drivers behind cancellations.

The analysis revealed that 37% of overall bookings were cancelled, largely driven by 47% of customers booking via Online Travel Agents (OTAs), where misleading information or flexibility led to non-commitment. The City Hotel segment and customers from Portugal (70% cancellations) contributed disproportionately to these figures. We also found that January saw the highest cancellation rates, possibly due to post-holiday financial constraints.

Through this project, I provided business-driven suggestions such as optimizing booking channels, enhancing direct reservations, launching seasonal promotions, and revising pricing strategies for Resort Hotels. The insights and recommendations aim to improve booking reliability, reduce cancellations, and increase hotel profitability.

The full analysis, visualizations, insights, and strategic recommendations are available in the detailed PDF report.
